This is the source code and content for the website powering [sjp.co.nz](https://sjp.co.nz/).

The website is primarily built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Additionally the site theme is built using the [hyde-hyde](https://github.com/htr3n/hyde-hyde) theme with some modifications. It is not intended to be used generally but you are welcome to re-use and modify to suit your needs. The key changes that were made is that a dark mode theme is now supported (and switchable).
