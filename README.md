# sjp.co.nz

This is the current state of the content hosted at [my personal website](http://sjp.co.nz/).

The current structure (of importance) the site is as follows:

* `content`: This folder holds all files that end up appearing on the site. This includes
  binary files and files that are given `published: false` that will not be processed.
* `layouts`: Currently this only contains the main layout of the site and is unlikely to change.
* `output`: The output folder is where all of the publishable content is placed upon
  compilation of the site.

Few modifications have been made to the CSS of the default [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) output.
The only one of significance was the creation of a snippet of javascript in order to ensure my email address
is not easily discovered by spammers. It's simply obfuscating the email address in a .js file, then replacing an
image which shows my email address with a mailto linking to my email address. The obfuscator can be made available upon
request.

Changes to the static/binary content (e.g. CSS, JS, images) in the `content` directory are expected
with the introduction of binary assets to nanoc.
