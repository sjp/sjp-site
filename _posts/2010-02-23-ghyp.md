Over the summer of 2009--2010 I undertook a summer studentship at the University of Auckland [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/). The project I undertook was to create a new package called GeneralizedHyperbolic based on [David Scott's](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~dscott/) [HyperbolicDist](http://cran.r-project.org/package=HyperbolicDist) package.

What the GeneralizedHyperbolic package does is it provides functions for use with the [generalised hyperbolic distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_hyperbolic_distribution) and related distributions. These functions include probability, density, quantile, fitting, checking and random observation generating functions.

The result of my work has been posted up on {% ghr sjp GeneralizedHyperbolic GitHub %}. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">To use the package, download the code, extract it to a folder and within that folder run `R CMD build .`. Once the package has been built, install it by running `R CMD INSTALL GeneralizedHyperbolic_0.1.tar.gz`.</span> GeneralizedHyperbolic is now available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=GeneralizedHyperbolic), to install the package simply run the following command within R: `install.packages("GeneralizedHyperbolic")`.

Once the package has been installed, using it is as simple as running R, then loading the package using `library(GeneralizedHyperbolic)`. Example usage is as follows:

{% highlight rconsole %}

I have created some extra code to go with this package that allows visualisation of the generalised hyperbolic distribution. Note, the slider tool was sourced from the [fBasics](http://cran.r-project.org/package=fBasics) package. With this tool, you can modify each parameter by moving a slider and noting the effects that this has. You can grab the code to do this at my [GHyp Slider gist](https://gist.github.com/311889).

Here is an example of the visualisation:
