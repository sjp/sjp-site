A series of [bootstrapping animations](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/BootAnim/) designed by [Dr. Chris Wild](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/showperson?firstname=Chris&surname=Wild) and built in R by Keng Hao Chang are available for viewing. These animations are useful for the purpose of teaching students statistical concepts using a more visual and engaging approach than using static graphics.

Although frame-by-frame animations were available, an attempt has been made by [Paul Murrell](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/) to replicate the "One-sample, continuous variable" example using gridSVG.

We can see that much of the animation has been replicated, however, because we are using native SVG animation the gridSVG example appears a lot smoother than the original.
