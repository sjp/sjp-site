[gridSVG](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/gridsvg/) is a package for [R](http://www.r-project.org/) that turns a [grid](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/grid/grid.html) plot into an SVG image. Under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Murrell](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/) I undertook both an honours project, and a [Masters thesis](/projects/msc-thesis) developing gridSVG. A basic illustration of how gridSVG differs from the built-in SVG device is shown below.

![Instead of using grDevices to create an SVG image for a grid plot, gridSVG creates the image directly.](/images/gridsvg-diagram.png =380x304)

The key advantage of using gridSVG is that new animated, interactive graphics can be produced more easily and transparently than by using the Cairo-based SVG device (see [SVGAnnotation](http://www.omegahat.org/SVGAnnotation/) for an alternative approach that uses the SVG device). Because the [lattice](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/lattice/) and [ggplot2](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/) packages use grid, gridSVG can add these features to plots produced by these packages. gridSVG only works with grid plots, to create animated and interactive plots from R's base graphics engine see [SVGAnnotation](http://www.omegahat.org/SVGAnnotation/).

Prior to my work on gridSVG, it was able to produce basic plots but lacked support for many of grid's graphics objects. On top of this, many of the graphics objects that were supported by gridSVG were not implemented correctly. An example where this was the case is when single grid graphics objects need to be translated into multiple SVG elements, either by vectorised parameters or objects with an `id` parameter.

After implementing almost all grid graphics objects and supporting their behaviour to a reasonable degree of accuracy, we can now reproduce lattice and ggplot2 plots using gridSVG. This means lattice and ggplot2 plots can make use of animation, interactivity and hyperlinking.

## Download

* [Download gridSVG via CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=gridSVG). To install gridSVG simply run `install.packages("gridSVG")` from within R.
* [Download development version of gridSVG via R-Forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/gridsvg/) (not recommended)

## Documentation

<p class="notice">This documentation could lag behind the latest version and is not intended to be canonical. Use the documentation provided with the package for up to date documentation.</p>

Documentation of the behaviour of gridSVG 0.7-0 is available below. Further information on the behaviour of gridSVG is available in Section 4 of my [honours report](/files/sjp-hons-report.pdf).

Many of the limitations noted in the listed documentation are no longer present in newer versions of gridSVG.
