The grConvert package is an [R](http://www.r-project.org/) package for
conveniently converting popular vector image formats (PostScript, PDF and SVG)
into valid input formats for the [grImport](http://cran.r-project.org/package=grImport)
and [grImport2]({% post_url 2014-10-06-grimport2 %}) packages. It was developed as part of the
2013 Google Summer of Code.

The key problem that grConvert aims to solve is that grImport requires
PostScript images whereas grImport2 requires SVG images to import vector
images into R. In particular, grImport2 is able to import only the SVG images
that are generated by the [Cairo](http://cairographics.org) graphics library.
By providing a simple way of generating valid images for these packages we can
use them more easily and effectively than would otherwise be the case.

To convert between image formats, grConvert leverages the following libraries:

* [libspectre](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libspectre/) for parsing PostScript images.
* [Poppler](http://poppler.freedesktop.org/) for parsing PDF images.
* [libRSVG](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/LibRsvg) for parsing SVG images.
* [Cairo](http://cairographics.org) for rendering parsed images in the target image format.

## Installation

### Linux

In order to install grConvert on Linux, some dependencies are required. A
command has been provided that installs the dependencies on Debian-based
distributions (e.g. Ubuntu).

{% highlight console %}
# apt-get install libcairo2-dev libspectre-dev librsvg2-dev \
>     libpoppler-glib-dev r-base-dev
{% endhighlight %}

If you have the [`devtools`](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package
installed, you can run the following command in R to install grConvert from a
GitHub repository.

{% highlight rconsole %}
> devtools::install_github("sjp/grConvert")
{% endhighlight %}

If you do not have `devtools`, or want to install grConvert from the [canonical
source](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/grimport/) you will need to
use [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/).

Firstly, we need to ensure that Subversion is installed on your system.
Following that, we can begin to check out the grConvert package.

{% highlight console %}
# apt-get install subversion
$ svn checkout svn://r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/grimport/pkg/grConvert
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight console %}
$ svn checkout svn://r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/grimport/pkg/grConvert
{% endhighlight %}

Finally we can build and install the grConvert package.

{% highlight console %}
$ cd grConvert
$ R CMD build .
$ R CMD INSTALL grConvert*.tar.gz
{% endhighlight %}

### OSX

The grConvert package has been tested and works on OSX. It requires the same
dependencies that the Linux installation uses, but by another name.

Using either [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) or [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
should suffice.

If using MacPorts, the following command will install the necessary libraries.

{% highlight console %}
$ port install cairo-devel poppler libspectre librsvg
{% endhighlight %}

If using Homebrew, the required libraries can be installed with the following
command.

{% highlight console %}
$ brew install poppler librsvg cairo
{% endhighlight %}

When last checked, `libspectre` was not available on Homebrew, therefore
using PostScript images for input will not be available when Homebrew is used.

If you have the [`devtools`](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package
installed, you can run the following command in R to install grConvert from a
GitHub repository.

{% highlight rconsole %}
> devtools::install_github("sjp/grConvert")
{% endhighlight %}

If you do not have `devtools`, or want to install grConvert from the [canonical
source](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/grimport/) you will need to
use [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/). It can be obtained via
Xcode's "Command Line Tools" downloadable component. Once Subversion has been
installed, open up an instance of Terminal and run the following command:

{% highlight console %}
$ svn checkout svn://r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/grimport/pkg/grConvert
{% endhighlight %}

Then run the following command to build and install the package in R.

{% highlight console %}
$ cd grConvert
$ R CMD build .
$ R CMD INSTALL grConvert*.tar.gz
{% endhighlight %}

Because I do not typically use OSX, these instructions may not be correct.
Please contact me if this is the case.

### Windows

Currently Windows support is *not available*. This is primarily due to the
difficulty in packaging grConvert's dependencies for use in a Windows
environment.

## Usage

The grConvert package is very minimal, exporting only two functions:
`grConvert.capabilities()` and `convertPicture()`.

The first function, `grConvert.capabilities()` is a utility function that
displays which input formats are supported by grConvert. In other words it
will inform the user which dependencies were available at install-time.


{% highlight rconsole %}
> library(grConvert)
> grConvert.capabilities()
Supported input formats: PostScript PDF SVG
{% endhighlight %}

The second function is the most important function, and performs the key task
of converting an input image (in a format listed by `grConvert.capabilities()`)
to an output image format of either PostScript or SVG (for grImport and 
grImport2 respectively).

{% highlight rconsole %}
> library(grConvert)

> # Convert a PS, PDF, SVG image to SVG
> # suitable for use with grImport2
> convertPicture("nzflag.ps", "nzflag-ps.svg")
> convertPicture("nzflag.pdf", "nzflag-pdf.svg")
> convertPicture("nzflag.svg", "nzflag-svg.svg")

> # Convert a PDF and SVG image to PS
> # suitable for use with grImport
> # (ignoring PS because grImport can already handle all PS inputs)
> convertPicture("nzflag.pdf", "nzflag-pdf.ps")
> convertPicture("nzflag.svg", "nzflag-svg.ps")
{% endhighlight %}

## Documentation

As with any R package, the documentation is provided with the package. For
more information on the `convertPicture()` function, type `?convertPicture`
into an R session.

Further information demonstrating its usage is available in the following locations:

grConvert and grImport2 packages](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/R/grImport2/grImport2.pdf). A draft article submitted to the R Journal.

A demonstration of the ability to import various vector images using USA state flags as a test case. It shows the capabilities (and limitations) of grConvert, grImport and grImport2 as it imports vector images into R.
