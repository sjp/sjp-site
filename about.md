This is the personal website of Simon Potter.

I am currently undertaking a Google Summer of Code project on
importing vector graphics into R graphics. I am also working for the
University of Auckland developing graphical software for teaching
statistical concepts to high school and undergraduate students.

Prior to this I undertook an, MSc in Statistics (by thesis), BSc
(Hons) in Statistics and a BCom/BSc in Information Systems, Computer
Science and Statistics.

My interests primarily lie in programming, data visualisation and data
analytics.
