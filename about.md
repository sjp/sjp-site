This is the personal website of Simon Potter. I am a student in my sixth year
of studies at the [University of Auckland](http://www.auckland.ac.nz) currently
undertaking an MSc in Statistics. Prior to this I undertook a BSc (Hons) in
Statistics and a BCom/BSc in Information Systems, Computer Science and
Statistics. My academic interests primarily lie in information visualisation,
data mining, and statistical computing.
