This is the personal website of Simon Potter.

I am currently employed as a Software Developer at IMS Health in Auckland.

Prior to this I undertook an MSc in Statistics (by thesis), BSc
(Hons) in Statistics and a BCom/BSc in Information Systems, Computer
Science and Statistics.

My interests primarily lie in programming, data visualisation and data
analytics.
