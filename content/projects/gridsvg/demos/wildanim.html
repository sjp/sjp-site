<p>A series of <a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/BootAnim/">bootstrapping animations</a> designed by <a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/showperson?firstname=Chris&amp;surname=Wild">Chris Wild</a> and built in R by Keng Hao Chang are available for viewing. These animations are useful for the purpose of teaching students statistical concepts using a more visual and engaging approach than using static graphics.</p>
            <p>Although frame-by-frame animations were available, an attempt has been made by <a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/">Paul Murrell</a> to replicate the "One-sample, continuous variable" example using gridSVG.</p>
            <p><object data="/projects/gridsvg/demos/wildanim/wildAnim.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="568" height="567"></object></p>
            <p>We can see that much of the animation has been replicated, however, because we are using native SVG animation the gridSVG example appears a lot smoother than the original.</p>
