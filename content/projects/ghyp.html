<p>Over the summer of 2009-2010 I undertook a summer studentship at the University of Auckland <a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/">Department of Statistics</a>. The project I undertook was to create a new package called GeneralizedHyperbolic based on <a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~dscott/">David Scott&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/package=HyperbolicDist">HyperbolicDist</a> package.</p>
            <p>What the GeneralizedHyperbolic package does is it provides functions for use with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_hyperbolic_distribution">generalised hyperbolic distribution</a> and related distributions. These functions include probability, density, quantile, fitting, checking and random observation generating functions.</p>
            <p>The result of my work has been posted up on <a href="http://github.com/sjp/GeneralizedHyperbolic/">GitHub</a>. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">To use the package, download the code, extract it to a folder and within that folder run <code>R CMD build .</code>. Once the package has been built, install it by running <code>R CMD INSTALL GeneralizedHyperbolic_0.1.tar.gz</code>.</span> GeneralizedHyperbolic is now available on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/package=GeneralizedHyperbolic">CRAN</a>, to install the package simply run the following command within R: <code>install.packages("GeneralizedHyperbolic")</code>.</p>
            <p>Once the package has been installed, using it is as simple as running R, then loading the package using <code>library(GeneralizedHyperbolic)</code>. Example usage is as follows:</p>
            <p><script src="http://gist.github.com/311872.js?file=ghyp-examples.R" type="text/javascript"></script></p>
            <p>I have created some extra code to go with this package that allows visualisation of the generalised hyperbolic distribution. Note, the slider tool was sourced from the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fBasics/index.html">fBasics</a> package. With this tool, you can modify each parameter by moving a slider and noting the effects that this has. You can grab the code to do this at my <a href="http://gist.github.com/311889">GHyp Slider gist</a>.</p>
            <p>Here is an example of the visualisation:</p>
