This project is my attempt to predict the weather for the Auckland region. At
the moment I'm currently in the stage of collecting data from
[Metservice](https://metservice.com/) using their JSON webservice.

All data is being stored in a SQLite database and is being collected via a
Python script. This database can be [downloaded here](/files/weather.db) if you
wish to perform your own analysis on the data. All source code is located in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/sjp/weather).
