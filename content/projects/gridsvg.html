<p>Under the supervision of <a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/">Dr. Paul Murrell</a> I undertook an honours project working on <a href="https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/gridsvg/">gridSVG</a>. gridSVG is a package for <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> that turns a <a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/grid/grid.html">grid</a> plot into an SVG image. A basic illustration of how gridSVG differs from the SVG device is shown below.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/gridsvg-diagram.png" width="380" height="304" alt="Instead of using grDevices to create an SVG image for a grid plot, gridSVG creates the image directly."></p>
            <p>The advantage of using gridSVG is that new animated, interactive graphics can be produced more easily and transparently than by using the Cairo-based SVG device (see <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/SVGAnnotation/">SVGAnnotation</a> for an alternative approach that uses the SVG device). Because the <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/lattice/">lattice</a> and <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/">ggplot2</a> packages use grid, gridSVG can add these features to plots produced by these packages. As gridSVG only works with grid plots, to create animated and interactive plots from R's base graphics engine, see <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/SVGAnnotation/">SVGAnnotation</a>.</p>
            <p>Prior to my work on gridSVG, it was able to produce basic plots but lacked support for many of grid's graphics objects. On top of this, many of the graphics objects that were supported by gridSVG were not implemented correctly. An example where this was the case is when single grid graphics objects are required to turn into multiple SVG elements, either by vectorised parameters or objects with the <code>id</code> parameter.</p>
            <p>After implementing almost all grid graphics objects and supporting their behaviour to a reasonable degree of accuracy, we can now reproduce lattice and ggplot2 plots using gridSVG. This means lattice and ggplot2 plots can make use of animation, interactivity and hyperlinking.</p>
