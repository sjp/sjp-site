This software, [iNZight](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/iNZight/), is a GUI for R used for exploratory data analysis. It is intended to be used by undergraduate statistics students.

Much of iNZight was written by Dineika Chandrananda. I maintained iNZight and developed extra components with some assistance from David Banks. The project is led by [Dr. Chris Wild](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/showperson?firstname=Chris&surname=Wild).

Current development occurs on GitHub in the {{< ghr user="iNZightVIT" repo="iNZight" >}} repository.

A basic screenshot showing a small subset of its features is shown below:
