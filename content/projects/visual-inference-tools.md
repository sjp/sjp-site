Along with [Garrett Grolemund](https://github.com/garrettgman), [Ben Stevenson](https://github.com/b-steve) and under the guidance of [Dr. Chris Wild](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/showperson?firstname=Chris&surname=Wild), I helped develop [Visual Inference Tools](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/VIT/). It is a GUI for R, used for teaching high school and undergraduate students statistical concepts by using animation. These concepts include bootstrapping, randomisation testing and confidence intervals.

I was formerly the maintainer of this R package. Development occurs on GitHub in the {{< ghr user="iNZightVIT" repo="VIT" text="Visual Inference Tools" >}} repository.

Some example animations (taken from the [VIT website](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/VIT/)) are visible below:
