<p>This software, <a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/iNZight/">iNZight</a>, is a GUI for R used for exploratory data analysis. It is intended to be used by undergraduate statistics students.</p>
                <p>Much of iNZight was written by Dineika Chandrananda. I have since been maintaining the package and developing extra components with some assistance from David Banks. The project is led by <a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/showperson?firstname=Chris&surname=Wild">Dr. Chris Wild</a>.</p>
                <p>Presently I am the maintainer of this R package and development occurs on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/sjp/iNZight">iNZight<img src="/images/github-favicon.png" class="nav-icon" alt="" height="16" width="16"></a> repository.</p>
                <p>A basic screenshot showing a small subset of its features is shown below:</p>
