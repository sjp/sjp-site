<p>The GOMstreamer tool is used to allow Windows, OSX and Linux users to watch the <a href="http://www.gomtv.net/">GOMtv GSL</a> via <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>. GOMstreamer was originally based on the prior work of <a href="https://github.com/tomasherman">Tomas Herman</a> but has been updated to work on newer seasons' streams, along with the addition of new features. <em>Note: This requires a <a href="http://www.gomtv.net/">GOMtv</a> account to work and the account must solely authenticate with GOMtv and not via a third party (e.g. Twitter, Facebook).</em></p>
            <p>There are two separate releases of GOMstreamer, one works in OSX and Linux while the other works solely on Windows.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#gom-windows">Windows</a></li>
                <li><a href="#gom-osx">OSX</a></li>
                <li><a href="#gom-linux">Linux</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p id="gom-windows"><strong>Windows</strong></p>
            <p>This release is called GOMstreamer.NET and requires .NET Framework 2.0 (or greater) to be installed. Any computer running XP, Vista or 7 should be able to run this fine.</p>
            <p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="/files/GOMstreamer.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/files/GOMstreamer.v0.7.1.zip']);">GOMstreamer.NET can be downloaded from this server</a>. Because this is a binary release, the source has been made available on <a href="https://github.com/sjp/GOMstreamer.NET">GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>Usage of GOMstreamer.NET is reasonably straightforward. Enter in the email address and password associated with your GOMtv account and select the location of VLC. If you want to watch the stream, set the mode to 'Play' to get VLC to play the GSL stream. The stream URL will appear in the textbox in case you want to use the stream with some other media player, or to share with others (useful if the GOMtv webserver is down). <em>Unfortunately due to recent changes from GOMtv this mode has been broken (unless someone can suggest a way of piping output from wget.exe to vlc.exe). To play a stream, just use the 'Save' mode and open the file in VLC as it is being saved.</em></p>
            <p>To save the GSL stream for later viewing, follow the same instructions as before but also set the location to save the stream to, then set the mode to 'Save'.</p>
            <p>In order to schedule a recording, follow the same instructions as for saving a stream, but set the mode to 'Delayed Save'. This will allow you to set a time at which recording should start. The time is specified in <em>Korean</em> time (HH:MM 24H). GOMstreamer.NET will minimise to the system tray until 1 minute prior to the recording starts in order to stay out of the way.
            <p>Note: <code>GOMstreamer.exe</code> must reside in the same directory as <code>wget.exe</code> in order to execute correctly.</p>
            <p>Example usage of GOMstreamer.NET is shown below:</p>

            <p><strong>Download:</strong> The latest version of GOMstreamer for OSX can be <a href="https://github.com/sjp/GOMstreamer/tarball/v0.7.1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/github.com/sjp/GOMstreamer/tarball/v0.7.1']);">downloaded via GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>To use GOMstreamer, enter your GOMtv email and password into the <code>play.command</code> script, along with the stream quality you wish to use out of <code>SQTest</code>, <code>SQ</code> and <code>HQ</code> (<em>Note: only <code>SQTest</code> will be available unless your GOMtv account has a premium ticket</em>). Execute the script when the GSL stream is live.</p>
            <p>To save the stream, enter in the relevant details into the <code>save.command</code> script. This requires setting your username, password, a stream quality, and a location to save to. Execute <code>save.command</code> to begin saving the stream.</p>
            <p>Streams can be scheduled to record at a specific time. This is accomplished via the use of the <code>delayed-save.command</code> script. Follow the same instructions as if you were saving the stream, but set the time at which the stream recording should begin in <em>Korean</em> time (HH:MM 24H).</p>
            <p>To play the stream that GOMstreamer dumped, open the file (default = <code>dump.ogm</code>) in any decent media player, like VLC. Note, you are able to watch the streams in VLC as they are downloading, though this will require another instance of VLC to be loaded.</p>
