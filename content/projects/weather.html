<p>This project is my attempt to predict the weather for the Auckland region. At the moment I'm currently in the stage of collecting data from <a href="http://metservice.com/">Metservice</a> using their JSON webservice.</p>
            <p>All data is being stored in a SQLite database and is being collected via a Python script. This database can be <a href="/files/weather.db">downloaded here</a> if you wish to perform your own analysis on the data. All source code is located in a <a href="http://github.com/sjp/weather">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
