This is the personal website of Simon Potter.

I am currently a Software Developer at [Starshipit](https://starshipit.com/).

Previously I've worked at the following companies:

* [Zip](https://zip.co/nz)
* [Datacom](https://datacom.co.nz/)
* [RLDatix](https://rldatix.com/) (formerly RL Solutions)
* [IQVIA](https://iqvia.com) (formerly IMS Health and Cegedim)

Prior to this I undertook an MSc in Statistics (by thesis), BSc
(Hons) in Statistics and a BCom/BSc in Information Systems, Computer
Science and Statistics. All of these were at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/).

My interests include robust and efficient software development techniques, with a particular focus on distributed software architectures.
