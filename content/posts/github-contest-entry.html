<p>During the middle of 2009, the web-based Git hosting service GitHub held <a href="http://contest.github.com/">a content recommendation contest</a>. The idea was to create an algorithm that would recommend a set of repositories that a user might be interested in. I attempted this contest although I wasn't exactly successful, mainly due to time issues and a lack of actual implementation. I will describe my process to getting where I wanted to go, along with the challenges faced.</p>
            <p>The data that GitHub had supplied for analysis was provided in three files, <code>data.txt</code>, <code>repos.txt</code> and <code>lang.txt</code>. The <code>data.txt</code> file was simply a key-value store, mapping user IDs to repository IDs. <code>repos.txt</code> listed for each repository ID the following: the repository name, the creation date and (if applicable) the ID of the repository that it was forked from. Finally, for each repository ID in <code>lang.txt</code>, the language name and the amount of code in that language (in lines) were given.</p>
            <p>My entry for this contest was written in <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> as I needed to learn it for a paper, and there's no better way to learn a language than by practice. Fortunately, because the datasets were small, I would not run into any issues regarding the exhaustion of memory.</p>
            <p>The first line of thought that went into the analysis of the data was to get it into a form where I could easily grab the information I wanted without having to parse through the txt files. My solution to this was to load the data into R, parse it, then run a large amount of <code>INSERT</code> queries into a SQLite database. This turned out to be reasonably quick to import all of the data, however the problem came when trying to query the database. The queries that I wanted to use on my SQLite database were <em>slow</em>, despite a few tricks I had applied to try to speed things up. As a result, I had to abandon the SQLite approach; this was a blessing in disguise as I would now be able to actually implement my algorithms in R and not SQL. In retrospect, trying to implement my recommendation queries in SQL was a bad idea; it should only have been used for a datastore, nothing more.</p>
